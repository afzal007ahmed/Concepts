2. ## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
   ### Report It
   * I would inform a supervisor, HR, or a designated authority within the organization about the incident.
  
   ### Seek Help
   * I would consider reaching out to a counselor or support group if the situation is affecting my well-being.

   ### Stay Vigilant
   * Keep an eye out for any further incidents and remain alert to ensure a safe environment for everyone.
